-------------------------------------
	4.0-4
-------------------------------------
Added Exclusive and VPID hardware acceleration options to
Acceleration tab visible when $enableAdvancedConfig is set.

Added "Automatic" SATA Port Count option to the SATA Port Count
list when $enableAdvancedConfig is set. New VMs created through
phpVirtualBox will automatically have this set to Auto.

Fixed bug that would display the Input tab rather than the
Description tab when clicking on the Description section link in
the VM Details section if $enableAdvancedConfig is set.

Fixed bug that would reload the list of VMs rather than refresh
the list when resetting a VM.

Fixed bug that would not change some settings when using
PHP < 5.2.0. This was reported by CentOS users regarding the
Cable Connected network setting in particular.
http://code.google.com/p/phpvirtualbox/issues/detail?id=192

Fixed bug that would not allow you to add a VM through Machine ->
Add when using PHP < 5.2.0.

Circumvent unconfirmed VirtualBox bug when trying to obtain a
screen shot for the Preview window returns "Could not take a
screenshot (VERR_TRY_AGAIN)." screen.php now runs
console->display->invalidateAndUpdate() on error.

VM settings while running are now available via the Settings
button on the toolbar. Moved Install Guest Additions function
to this menu.

Added more files to default $browserRestrictFiles setting.

OS Type can now be changed when importing a VM.

Added $previewAspectRatio config option.

Fixed bug that would always set consoleHost to the server being
connected to as specified by $location in config.php.
http://code.google.com/p/phpvirtualbox/issues/detail?id=199

To ensure a more sane default setting, the remote display IP is
now determined in the following order:
	- consoleHost setting if set in config.php
	- IP address if set in VM's vrdeaddress setting
	- IP address / host specified of server's $location setting
		in config.php
	- If setting is 127.0.0.1 or localhost, use phpVirtualBox's IP
		address / hostname in its URL as determined by the web
		browser.

Fixed multi-server bug when initial server is unreachable.
http://code.google.com/p/phpvirtualbox/issues/detail?id=200

Added basic authentication and associated options.

Fixed Opera bug that would cause it to stop refreshing the list of
VMs.

Maximize use of browser caching when grabbing images for preview
window utilizing ETag and If-Modified-Since HTTP headers.

Added Parallel Port configuration and associated $enableLPTConfig
configuration setting - EXPERIMENTAL - VirtualBox provides no
documentation or official support for this. Nor can I. LPT support
only works in Linux.

Added CD/DVD and Floppy drives to host details.

Host details now displays CPU features if $enableAdvancedConfig
is enabled.

OS Type selectors now properly display only OS types supported by
the VirtualBox host based on its processors' features.

Minor UI changes.

Adding media through the Virtual Media Manager now updates the
"recent media" list.

Added advanced NAT settings for Network Adapters visible when
$enableAdvancedConfig is set.

Updated German translations.

Added GPLv3.txt and updated verbiage in LICENSE.txt.

Updated Storage VM Settings pane to mimic VirtualBox GUI resizable
behavior.

Added right-click functionality to VMs in the VM list.

Added more vmListSort options - including the option to manually
sort VMs with drag-and-drop. See config.php-example.

-------------------------------------
	4.0-3	2011-2-10
-------------------------------------
UI fixes for some browsers when dragging the resize bar.

SATA controllers can now have CD/DVD media attachments.

Support for Chipset option on Motherboard tab in VM settings when
VirtualBox >= 4.0.2 is detected.
http://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/7885

Snapshots with no children can be deleted while VM is running.

have JSON enabled / installed.

Language can now be changed in File -> Preferences -> Language.

UI changes in an attempt to make things look and feel less "flat."

JavaScript changes to speed things up in IE.

Added VDE Network adapter support. Your underlying VirtualBox
installation must support this, and it must be enabled in
config.php.

Fixed improper display of Remote Display Server port when
accessing phpVirtualBox through http://ip:port/..

To ensure proper configuration when accessing the remote display
of a VM through NAT, remote display IP is now determined in the
following order:
	- consoleHost setting if set in config.php
	- IP address if set in VM's vrdeaddress setting
	- phpVirtualBox's IP address / hostname in its URL as
		determined by the web browser

Added Serial Port configuration.

Added $disableSataPortCount config option to disable setting SATA
controllers' port count to the max port number found when saving
VM settings.

New Hard Disk Wizard hard disk location defaults to VM's folder
where appropriate.

Fixed bug that would not allow the creation of Fixed size storage.

Added $enableAdvancedConfig to configuration options in config.php.
This allows you to change the following VM configuration options:
	- HPET (System section -> Motherboard tab)
	- Nested Paging (System section -> Acceleration tab)
	- Large Pages (System section -> Acceleration tab)
	- VT-x / AMD-V (System section -> Acceleration tab)
	- VRDE Net Address (Display section -> Remote Display tab)
	- SATA Port Count (Storage section -> select a SATA controller)
	- Mouse type (General section -> Input tab)
	- Keyboard type (General section -> Input tab)
	- Create new hard disk from Virtual Media Manager (New button)
	- Add new media from Virtual Media Manager (Add button)
	- Clone hard disk from Virtual Media Manager
		(Actions menu -> Clone)
	- Make hard disk immutable from Virtual Media Manager
		(Actions menu -> Immutable)
	- Make hard disk "normal" from Virtual Media Manager
		(Actions menu -> Normal)
	- Add iSCSI disk from Virtual Media Manager (Add iSCSI button)
	- All media selection menus have a Virtual Media Manager
		button
			
Note that these items will not be translated. See the VirtualBox
documentation for more information on what these settings will
change / actions these will perform.

Media selection now behaves the same as it does in the VirtualBox
GUI.

Some features of the Virtual Media Manager have been removed to
mimic the one in the VirtualBox GUI.

Changed versioning schema.

New configuration model where config.php-example is distributed
instead of config.php. This should allow for persistent user
configuration. All config logic is now in lib/config.php.

-------------------------------------
	4-2 - 2011-1-14
-------------------------------------
Viewing a VM's screenshot in a new window while running now
prints a descriptive error rather than displaying a blank
screen if the Oracle VM Extension Pack is not installed.

Re-enabled console tab in IE. Disabling it in the first place
was because of a HUGE oversight on my part :) Which leads to
the next feature.

Console tab now displays a message if the Adobe Flash plugin is
not installed.

Host network card and drive list is now properly refreshed when
refreshing host info via the Machine -> Refresh menu item.

Added MAC Address to Guest Network Adapters dialog.

Default RDP port when creating a VM is now 3389-4000. Allowing
for a range of ports.

Fixed VM creation bug that created all VMs with an Unknown OS
type and name set to the specified OS type.

Fixed VM creation bug that would incorrectly display 'None' as
the hard drive after creation until the newly created VM was
refreshed.

Tuned down PHP error reporting to keep Notices from being
displayed when PHP's default error reporting is set too high
in user's PHP config.

Fixed bug that would not display a list of internal networks
in VM network settings.

Network settings are now (somewhat) changable while a VM is
running. This mimics the same functionality as the VirtualBox
GUI.

Shared folder settings are now changable while a VM is
running.

Added VirtualBox guest additions installation feature.

Added 'Add VM' feature.

Fixed issue where VM disks were created in the VirtualBox
folder rather than being created in the VM folder when using
the New Virtual Machine Wizard.

Fixed bug that would not import SCSI controllers and attached
disk images when using the Import Appliance Wizard.

Added progress operation images.

Updated text when deleting / removing a VM to match VirtualBox
GUI.

USB devices can now be attached / detached to a running VM.

Medium attachments for storage controllers on VM details tab
are now properly sorted instead of printed in the arbitrary
order that they are read from VirtualBox.

VRDE Server (remote display) is now enabled by default when
creating a new VM.

Refreshing the VirualBox host in the machine list now refreshes
system properties cache as well.

Fixed preview window scrolling bug. In some browsers, the
preview thumbnail would stay in place as the window was
scrolled.

Fixed browser quirks when switching VMs. This would cause the
vm list pane to grow in width while a VM was loading in
certain browsers.

-------------------------------------
	4-1 - 2011-01-09
-------------------------------------
Changed behavior of file browser to always use config setting
for browserLocal regardless of browser's host. This should be
OK now that IVFSExplorer bugs are fixed in VirtualBox 4.0.

Fixed bug in Create HardDisk wizard functionality that would
only allow a disk of size 1MB to be created.

Fixed bug in display settings when the RDP extension pack is
not installed.

Fixed "Detach" console bug.

Disable Console tab when IE is detected. The Flash RDP client
from Oracle does not appear to work with IE. Even the demo
distributed with the flash control does not work. It appears
that RDPWebEventLoaded event is never triggered after the
flash control loads. -- Invalid - 2011-1-10

Max HD slider size in New HD wizard is now limited to 512GB.
Anything over that and the slider loses so much precision that
it becomes useless. You may still type a larger size in the
size text box. E.g. "1 TB"

-------------------------------------
	4-0 - 2011-01-07
-------------------------------------
UI and back-end changes to match new version of VirtualBox.

Updated jquery-ui to 1.8.2.

Added json_encode() for PHP compiled with --disable-json and
PHP versions < 5.2.0.

Fixed compatibility issues with PHP 5.1.x.

Fixed case sensitivity for $browserRestrictFiles setting.

Fixed bug when using OSE where the Shared Folders section would
not be selected when "Shared Folders" is clicked on from the
Details tab / section.

Exporting a VM defaults to '.ova' file.

Added language contexts.

Changed cache temp dir location to try environment variables
first.

You can now power off a VM that is in a "Stuck" state.

Versioning scheme is now
	(VirtualBox compatible version)-(phpVirtualBox version)

Fixed bug that would not display error message on failure to
connect to vboxwebsrv.

Removed old imgpng requirement as VirtualBox can now export
screenshots as PNG data.

Fixed media mounting bug that would not allow anything other than
host drives to be mounted.

-------------------------------------
		0.5 - 2010-08-10
-------------------------------------
Fixed some English translations.

Added fr_fr and de_de languages. 

Fixed top toolbar and Virtual Media Manger translation bugs.

Fixed OSE startup bug and removed console tab when OSE is
detected.

Fixed Host Details bug that would not display the VirtualBox
host server's details when it is selected in the list of vms.

Fixed bug in File -> Preferences that would not correctly
reflect a change made to any prefrences on the General tab.

Workaround for Console tab resize bug that would disconnect from
an existing console session when the window was resized. Now, it
automatically reconnects after a window resize event.

Applied UI enhancements patch supplied by compuwizard123
http://code.google.com/u/compuwizard123/

Host details now include VirtualBox version.

-------------------------------------
		0.4 - 2010-07-24
-------------------------------------
Fixed numerous translation bugs.

Fixed bug that would not allow the addition of more than 4
storage controller types in VM Settings.

Changed WSDL cache to use memory only instead of both memory
and disk. (PHP SoapClient WSDL_CACHE_MEMORY option).

RDP host (for console tab and details tab RDP links) is now
selected in the following order:
	1) VM Configured host (would have to be set with VboxManage)
	2) rdpHost setting in config.php
	3) host in location setting of config.php
	*) if host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' use web browser
		location's URL host as last resort

Fixed bug in file / folder browser that would display the full
path of files / folders rather than just their names. This only
affected *nix web servers connecting to VirtualBox running on
Windows hosts. I can't imagine this is a very common scenario:)

Better error handling and meaningful error message when there
is a PHP error, and phpVirtualBox fails to load.

Fixed bug that would not allow you to enter your own internal
network name in VM network configurations where Attached To: is
set to Internal Network.

Fixed bug that would break phpVirtualBox when
allow_call_time_pass_reference is set to Off in php.ini.

Removed ReflectionClass dependency. This also changes all
config options in config.php to use 'var' instead of 'const.'

License changed from GPL to MIT.

-------------------------------------
        0.3 - 2010-07-05
-------------------------------------
Fixed bug in file/folder browser that would incorrectly display
files as folders and folders as files in some cases.

Added Console tab.

Added OSE support. This effectively removes the console tab,
USB, and VRDP support when OSE is detected.

Fixed bug in Host-networking interfaces pane that would cause
tabs to disappear if editing a host interface more than once
without refreshing.

Made VM list and main tab content scrollable.

Added Guest Network Adapter info. This queries guest additions
for network adapter IP information of a running VM.

Added Clone, Make Immutable, and Make Normal functionality to
Virtual Media Manager.

Fixed bug in Virtual Media Manager that would allow a user to
try to release a medium that is attached to a snapshot. This
attempt would always fail.

Fixed bug that would cause saving USB filters to fail.

Added Import / Export Appliance. NOTE: Some configurable
import settings are ignored (e.g. network interface type).
These are also ignored when importing from the VirtualBox
GUI, and so appears to be a bug in VirtualBox itself.

Added file type icons to file / folder browser.

Fixed ineternal network dropdown list in Virtual Machine
settings.
