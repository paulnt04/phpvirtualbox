-------------------------------------
-------------------------------------
Fixed some English translations.

Added fr_fr and de_de languages. 

Fixed top toolbar translation bug.

Fixed OSE startup bug and removed console tab when OSE is
detected.

Fixed Host Details bug that would not display the VirtualBox
host server's details when it is selected in the list of vms.

Fixed bug in File -> Preferences that would not correctly
reflect a change made to any prefrences on the General tab.

-------------------------------------
		0.4 - 2010-07-24
-------------------------------------
Fixed numerous translation bugs.

Fixed bug that would not allow the addition of more than 4
storage controller types in VM Settings.

Changed WSDL cache to use memory only instead of both memory
and disk. (PHP SoapClient WSDL_CACHE_MEMORY option).

RDP host (for console tab and details tab RDP links) is now
selected in the following order:
	1) VM Configured host (would have to be set with VboxManage)
	2) rdpHost setting in config.php
	3) host in location setting of config.php
	*) if host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' use web browser
		location's URL host as last resort

Fixed bug in file / folder browser that would display the full
path of files / folders rather than just their names. This only
affected *nix web servers connecting to VirtualBox running on
Windows hosts. I can't imagine this is a very common scenario:)

Better error handling and meaningful error message when there
is a PHP error, and phpVirtualBox fails to load.

Fixed bug that would not allow you to enter your own internal
network name in VM network configurations where Attached To: is
set to Internal Network.

Fixed bug that would break phpVirtualBox when
allow_call_time_pass_reference is set to Off in php.ini.

Removed ReflectionClass dependency. This also changes all
config options in config.php to use 'var' instead of 'const.'

License changed from GPL to MIT.

-------------------------------------
        0.3 - 2010-07-05
-------------------------------------
Fixed bug in file/folder browser that would incorrectly display
files as folders and folders as files in some cases.

Added Console tab.

Added OSE support. This effectively removes the console tab,
USB, and VRDP support when OSE is detected.

Fixed bug in Host-networking interfaces pane that would cause
tabs to disappear if editing a host interface more than once
without refreshing.

Made VM list and main tab content scrollable.

Added Guest Network Adapter info. This queries guest additions
for network adapter IP information of a running VM.

Added Clone, Make Immutable, and Make Normal functionality to
Virtual Media Manager.

Fixed bug in Virtual Media Manager that would allow a user to
try to release a medium that is attached to a snapshot. This
attempt would always fail.

Fixed bug that would cause saving USB filters to fail.

Added Import / Export Appliance. NOTE: Some configurable
import settings are ignored (e.g. network interface type).
These are also ignored when importing from the VirtualBox
GUI, and so appears to be a bug in VirtualBox itself.

Added file type icons to file / folder browser.

Fixed ineternal network dropdown list in Virtual Machine
settings.
